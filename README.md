# React Zipcode Task

Create an application to collect a userâ€™s *name*, *address* and *zipcode*.

## Implementation instructions
* Use modern front-end technologies (Feel free to use the [react-app starting point](##react-app:-starting-point))
* Use `zipcodes.json` to validate the provided zip-code
* Provide a minimal *README* containing your approach and running instructions
* Write meaningful *tests* that prove your solution
* Provide meaningful *commit-messages*
* Keep external libraries to an absolute minimum (we prefer a homebrew solution that is not 100% feature-par with a out-of-the-box third-party-solution to see your skills)

## Minimum requirements
* *Input fields* for name, address, city and zipcode
* *Validation* that name and address are *not empty*
* *Validation* that the provided *zipcode* is *valid and located in germany*
* *Submit-Button*

## Optional features
* Create a modern and easy-to-use GUI
* Autocompletion for city-names while the user is typing
* Submit-button is only clickable if inputs are valid

## Additional information
The task should take about 2 hours to complete. Feel free to further improve your solution.
